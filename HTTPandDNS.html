        <h2>What are they?</h2>
        <h3>HTTP:</h3>
        <P>HTTP stands for Hyptertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol that is used to recieve and request data (webpages, audio, images, videos, etc.) over the internet from servers. For example, wanting to visit a website.</P>
        <p>It relies on DNS to locate where to request the data and TCP to establish a connection to the server. Once the server gets the request, it sends the data back, enabling the user to see and interact with what they requested.</P>

        <h3>DNS:</h3><p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It translates the websites (.com, .org, etc.) into IP addresses to locate the server with that web page. An IP address could look something like (192.153.1.1). They are what allows you to find servers and other computers. </p>
