        <h1>What are Routers, Redundancy, and Packets?</h1>
        <h3>Routers</h3>
        <p>Routers are devices that directs where data goes between two networks. It allows one to use to internet. The main job of a router is to find the best path for data to travel across from one network to another. To send information, it uses <a href="HTTPandDNS.html">DNS</a> to find its IP address.</p>

        <h3>Redundancy</h3>
        <p>The word redundancy in terms of engineering, means having an extra component or another way in case other components fail. Since the internet is very complicated and many people use it daily, there must be multiple ways data can travel if a router, pathway, etc. fails. Therefore the system is composed of multiple strings conntected to multiple routers.</p>

        <h3>Packets</h3>
        <p>Packets are split up pieces of data that are sent over a network. It is split into smaller pieces to make it easier to transport. All packets do not always travel the same route or arrive to the final destinantion in order. Once it arrives at the destination, it is reassembled into the original message.</p>
